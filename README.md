# azureml-demo-component
This repo is meant to contain a demo component to show full SDL. The component is a simple Python script that takes a CSV file as input and outputs a CSV file with the same data but with an additional column that contains the sum of the values in each row. The component is meant to be used in an Azure ML pipeline.
